Setup Notes from Tamara:  [notes by Jason]

Some thoughts:

-It would be best if you or Jason set it up so that you are the owner.  [Set up with BNZ as owner]

-It would be easiest if it is a public repo. Only people with access would be able to push changes, but anyone could see the code and data. [public it is]

-I would recommend that we keep the data on Google Drive, and read and write to there, rather than pushing the data to GitHub. That will require a little bit of set-up on your end so that the data files can’t be accidentally manipulated or wiped. I use the googledrive package to read & write to Drive and can provide some skeleton code.

-I use GitKraken to manage communication with GitHub. It is the rare instance where a gui is actually better. [I have tried GitKraken and was not a fan but am also a novice; it seems that personal choice is a big factor in GUIs.  Do you use the free or paid version? ]

-To get started you’ll just need to init a new repo and put an .Rproj in there. I can walk one of you through this if needed. [I think I did this step but need someone to verify it is correct]

-The big issue to remember is always pull changes before beginning to work so you don’t create merge conflicts with someone else’s work.  [Still working to collect or develop BP guidelines to ensure integrity]
